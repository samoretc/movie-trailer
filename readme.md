This is a project that creates a web page of your favorite movies including their posters and trailers!

If you want to add your favorite movies, you can edit the entertainment_center.py file. All that needs to be done is to create instances of the movie class including the movie's title, description, image url, and youtube trailer url. 

In order to execute this script, run the entertainment_center.py file. This will create the HTML page in the same directory. You should be able to open this page from any browser and view your favorite movies!
